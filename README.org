#+TITLE: FlatUi Dark Theme

A dark theme for Emacs inspired by [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/grandshell-theme][grandshell-theme]] and [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme][leuven-theme]], using the [[https://flatuicolors.com/][FlatUi colors]].  It also has support for using ~variable-pitch-mode~ in conjunction with ~org-mode~.

* Usage

In Emacs24 you can just use ~M-x customize-themes~ to select themes.

If you want to load the theme in your ~.emacs~ or similar you can add:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(load-theme 'flatui-dark t)
;; Optionally turn on variable fonts for org-mode
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'variable-pitch-mode)
#+END_SRC

and the theme should be loaded and activated on startup.
